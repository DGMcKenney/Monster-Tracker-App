# Monster Tracker App
## A (Slightly Facetious) Web App for Tracking Cryptid Sightings

- a __Django__-based web app that connects to a __postgreSQL__ database
- allows users to register to report cryptid sightings in their neighborhood
- maintains a database of all crypids as well as all sightings reported
